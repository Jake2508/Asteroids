## Overview

AstroHaul is an arcade game based on Asteroids. The player must destroy asteroids and collect minerals to gain a high score. 
While avoiding black holes & gravity wells from nearby objects. This game was built in 3 days using **Unity**, and all artwork was created by myself in Aseprite.
